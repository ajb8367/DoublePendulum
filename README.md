Hello!

This is my Physics 211 Honors Project. 
Using Swing elements, and a Runge-Kutta-Nystrom Algorithm from Erwin Felhberg, I simulate the dynamics of a double pendulum over time.
Unfortunately, I was unable to make it as time-accurate as I wanted it to be, but it still shows the almost-periodicity and chaos of the system, and I accomplished what I sent out to do.

There were prior steps to the final product of this project:
 - Using a simpler RKN method to model the elastic pendulum in Desmos
 - Using Felhberg's RKN method to model the classic pendulum in JavaX Swing
 - Using Felhberg's RKN method to model the elastic pendulum in JavaX Swing
